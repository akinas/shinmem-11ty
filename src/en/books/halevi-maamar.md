### A critical edition of an anonymous medieval Hebrew translation and its Judeo-Arabic source 

Rabbi Moshe ben Yosef Halevi of Seville, a 13th-century Jewish philosopher, was an authority in metaphysics, geometry, and music theory. In his _Metaphysical Treatise_, he explores the question of the identity of the Prime Mover, a crucial issue in medieval philosophy.

In this work, Rabbi Moshe Halevi aims to establish the validity of Avicenna’s stance in his debate with Averroes regarding whether the Prime Mover is God Himself or the first immaterial intellect that emanated from Him. This question has significant implications for the proof of God’s existence, specifically whether it should be based on physical or metaphysical foundations.

References to Rabbi Moshe Halevi in Hebrew works primarily stem from Rabbi Hasdai Crescas’s mentions of Halevi in his book _Light of the Lord_, where he recognizes Halevi as one of the greatest philosophers.

This is the first edition of the _Metaphysical Treatise_, and undoubtedly, it will provide new insights into the history of medieval philosophy and the reception of philosophical ideas from Judeo-Arabic sources within Hebrew texts.
